 ## Machine Learning algorithms cannot work directly with categorical data and you do need to do some amount of engineering and transformations on this data before you can start modeling on your data.
 
# Categorical Data
A categorical data is usually in the form of discrete values which belongs to a specific finite set of categories. 
These are also known as classes or labels in the contect of attributes or variables which are to be predicted by a model. 
These values can be text or numeric in nature. There are two major classes of categorical data:
Normal :-
There is no concept of ordering amongst the values of that attribute.
Example- Weather___ we have six major classes or categories in this particular scenario without any concept or notion of order (windy doesn’t always occur before sunny nor is it smaller or bigger than sunny).
ordinal :- 
This one has some sense or notion of order amongst its values. 
Exmaple:- Shirt size____ It is quite evident that order or in this case ‘size’ matters when thinking about shirts (S is smaller than M which is smaller than L and so on).
