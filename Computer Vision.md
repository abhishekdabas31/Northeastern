# Computer Vision
So the main question is how does our Brain work?
This is one of the major questions in Neuroscience and Machine Learning!!! yet to be answered

## Neural nets are suppose to mimic the way our brain works, but still i believe we are far being figuring out whether we can predict how our brain works!!

Coming back to #Computer Vision, 
as we have not figured out how our brain is able to depict every thing, and understand what is what, so i believe we are still not sure about the algorithms we are using for predicting images!!
Computer Vision is mainly pattern prediction- we train our algorithms with some test data ( images with labels), and the machine trys to figure out the pattern in those data which later can be used for prediction of a image without a label.
# Example:-
If you feed an image of Dog to the machine, maybe Millions of images of Dogs, 
the algorithm will try and figure out the different patterns of colors, different shapes in which it can be showed, distances, borders.
When finished the computer will be able to use its experience when fed other unlabeled images of dogs
