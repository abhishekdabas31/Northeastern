# Python

## A list is similar to an array in C++ 
>>> language = [a,[1,2,3,],b,cdefg, 1, True, False,'No']
You can put any kind of valuein a list - boolean, numeric , string, a list itself or a tuple

things you can do in a list :-
1. Accessing an entire list
>> list
2. Accessing a single item from the list
>> list1[3]
3. Slicing a python list
>> list1[1:4]
4. List is mutable
>> languages[2]='Java'
5. deleting a list
>>del languages[2]

## List is mutable, Tuples are not 
>>> colors = ('red', 'green' , 'blue')
1. sincle element tuple
>> a=(1)
### We can perform these operations on a tuple just like we can on a list. The only differences that exist are because a tuple is immutable, so you canâ€™t mess with a single item or a slice

## Python set, is just like the mathematical set
>> myset={3,1,2}
1. No duplicate values
2. It is unordered
there is no way we can use indexing to access or delete its elements
3. It is mutable (like List)

## Python dictionary holds key-value pairs.
>> mydict = {1:2,2:3,3:4}
