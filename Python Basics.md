# Python

## A list is similar to an array in C++ 
>>> language = [a,[1,2,3,],b,cdefg, 1, True, False,'No']
You can put any kind of valuein a list - boolean, numeric , string, a list itself or a tuple

things you can do in a list :-
1. Accessing an entire list
>> list
2. Accessing a single item from the list
>> list1[3]
3. Slicing a python list
>> list1[1:4]
4. List is mutable
>> languages[2]='Java'
5. deleting a list
>>del languages[2]

## Tuples:
A tuple is an (immutable) ordered list of values. A tuple is in many ways similar to a list;
one of the most important differences is that tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries and as elements of sets, while lists cannot.

## List is mutable, Tuples are not 
>>> colors = ('red', 'green' , 'blue')
1. sincle element tuple
>> a=(1)
### We can perform these operations on a tuple just like we can on a list. The only differences that exist are because a tuple is immutable, so you canâ€™t mess with a single item or a slice

## Python set, is just like the mathematical set
>> myset={3,1,2}
1. No duplicate values
2. It is unordered
there is no way we can use indexing to access or delete its elements
3. It is mutable (like List)

## Python dictionary holds key-value pairs.
>> mydict = {1:2,2:3,3:4}

# Numpy
Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.

## Arrays
A numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. The number of dimensions is the rank of the array; the shape of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.

`
e = np.random.random((2,2)) 
print(e)
[[0.57688929 0.54616642]
[0.28299089 0.10060504]]
`
## Series
A Series is a one-dimensional array of indexed data. One of the huge benefits of Pandas is that it supports both integer and label-based indexing, and provides a host of methods for performing operations involving the index. The first column is known as an index. And, each of the other columns corresponds to a Series. The first Series is called City, where the Olympics were held. The second Series is called the Edition, and this is the year the Olympics were held, and so on.
