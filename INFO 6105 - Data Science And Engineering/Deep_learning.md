# Gradient descent
Since the loss depends on the weights, we must find a certain set of weights for which the value of the loss function is as small as possible. The method of minimizing the loss function is achieved mathematically by a method called gradient descent.

# In data science, the cost function calculates the difference between your model predictions and your data set.

## Cost function 
It is “a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some “cost” associated with the event”. In more practical terms, it’s a function to calculate a parameter that you are about to either minimize or maximize.
